                <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
                <p>This work term report is an overview of my experience as a co-op student during my second of two work terms as a Data Collection & Integration Assistant at Kenna. This work term took place from September 2023 to December 2023, and I had a great experience.</p>

                <h4>ABOUT KENNA</h4>
                <p>Kenna is a marketing solutions company that aims to deliver a more unified customer experience. Kenna's mission is to help their clients meet the rapidly changing demands of their customers in less time and effort than it would take on their own. Kenna is a "one-stop-shop" for their clients, notably BASF (the largest chemical producer in the world), with in-house teams such as planning, communications, digital solutions, data collection, and much more.</p>

                <h4>WORK TERM GOALS</h4>
                <p>I had three main goals this work term, one of which carried over from my previous work term at Kenna. These goals were to improve my inquiry and analysis skills as well as my overall communication skills throughout the POG reconciliation process, and to improve my problem-solving ability by taking on an independent project to help automate and streamline the file import quality assurance (QA) process.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis</h4>
                <p>My first goal for this work term was to improve my inquiry and analysis skills through investigating and analyzing discrepancies throughout the POG reconciliation process. A discrepancy occurs when we have processed more/less of a certain product than what a retailer claims they have sold. I wanted to learn the reasons why a discrepancy might occur, learn to use SQL queries to determine the direct cause of each discrepancy, and then begin to recognize the patterns in which certain discrepancies were occurring.</p>
                <p>Throughout the term, I gained a better understanding of the causes behind discrepancies. Most of the discrepancies I encountered where we processed less of a product were because of transactions that were not imported (transactions we didn't see fit), whereas discrepancies where we processed more of a product tended to be due to human error (importing duplicates, incorrect product mapping, a file imported incorrectly, etc.) I only encountered one discrepancy that I was unable to figure out right away, where a retailer happened to have missing data they needed to submit.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>COMMUNICATING - Integrative Communication </h4>
                <p>My second goal for this work term was to improve my overall communication skills during the POG reconciliation (validation) process. I wanted to improve my communication skills in all areas, whether that was communicating clearly with retailers over phone and email, investigating discrepancies with colleagues, or documenting the overall process of validation.</p>
                <p>Throughout the term, I improved my ability to articulate the validation process to retailers to retailers. Admittedly at the start of the term I had some trouble understanding it myself, but as the term went on I gained a much better understanding, which ultimately made the retailer's life as well as my own much easier. I also improved my ability to explain my thought process for investigating discrepancies while collaborating with colleagues, and I worked on documenting every step I took during the validation process to ensure everything was up to date and that I would be able to explain my overall process to others.</p>

                <h4>PROBLEM-SOLVING - File Import QA Template</h4>
                <p>My third goal for this work term was to improve my problem-solving ability through an independent project to automate and streamline the file import QA process. This goal carried over from my previous work term at Kenna.</p>
                <p>The goal for this project was to greatly reduce the amount of manual set-up and processes that were required to do file import QA, manifested as an Excel template. The nature of file import QA is that there will always be some manual work, however, some things were greatly improved: </p>
                <p>Embedded SQL queries: It used to be required that the user would run several queries independent of Excel and then copy over the results. I worked on embedding SQL queries natively in Excel. I also implemented in macro that would allow the user to refresh each query with a parameter contained in a certain cell.</p>
                <p>---screenshot---</p>
                <p>Standardized pivot tables: the user used to be required to manually create a pivot table based on raw data that they imported into Excel. Each pivot table used to be different, given that formatting was inconsistent across retailers, even within retailers on a file-to-file basis.</p>
                <p>Implementing a solution for this was relatively simple for retailers with a single location -- I created a macro that creates a standardized pivot table under the assumption that the user changes certain column headers to match the column mapping in our database. It was much more difficult for retailers with multiple locations, which required a "Location Name" field within the pivot table. Retailer-submitted location data tended to be wildly inconsistent, so I had to create a query called "RetailReference" that provide a map for standardizing location data. Once this was created, a similar macro was implemented to create a standardized pivot table.</p>
                <p>---screenshot---</p>
                <p>Filled-in VLOOKUPs and formulas: the user used to be required to manually enter formulas due to inconsistent pivot table formatting. With a standardized pivot table I was able to fill in these formulas.</p>
                <p>In terms of next steps, some improvements could be made aeshetically, as well as in terms of clarity with regards to the instructions within the template along with more robust error messaging. I wasn't able to test as rigourously as I would have liked, just by nature of the template's implementation. By necessity, the template was designed in a manner where the raw data needed to conform to the template, not that the template needed to conform to the raw data. That is, the template's requirements were very rigid and unforgiving for the user, and that is partly be design. There was a lack of variability in terms of the different things I was able to test.</p>

                <h4>JOB DESCRIPTION & RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
                <p>As a Data Collection & Integration Assistant at Kenna, I was responsible for a wide variety of tasks and challenges, which often varied on a day-to-day basis. Most of my time was spent doing data mapping, where I mapped product/grower data to already existing data within our database (we called this "linking"). This required me to think quite heuritically, I had to have a great attention to detail and be able to deal with missing/duplicate/contradictory data. Throughout both of my work terms at Kenna, I completed over 5500 links with 100% accuracy (within the sample size that was tested).</p>
                <p>I also performed data analysis in the form of quantity/price thresholds, where I looked at certain quantities/prices in relation to purchase/price history. Often, this required me to run queries to check this and use heuristics as well. Throughout both of my terms at Kenna, I completed over 2000 data thresholds with 100% accurancy (within the sample size that was tested).</p>
                <p>A subset of these data links and data thresholds required that I make direct communication with retailers and growers to follow-up on missing data, contradictory data, etc. On occasion, my communication with retailers expanded to designated calling campaigns, where I was responsible for gathering various information from retailers or relaying important information to them.</p>
                <p>All of these tasks mentioned above were consistent throughout both of my worm terms at Kenna. However, during the fall term a good amount of my time was spent doing POG reconciliation/validation, the process in which every transaction from the 2023 growing season was validated. This involved a lot of work in Excel and SQL examining and resolving discrepancies, as well as regular communication with retailers to discuss validation progress and to discuss discrepancies.</p>

                <h4>RELATION TO ACADEMIC STUDIES</h4>
                <p>Throughout both of my work terms at Kenna, I acquired a lot of transferable skills that could be applied to my future studies. I was given the opportunity to take on an independent project, which has ultimately improved my Excel and SQL skills by a wide margin. My attention to detail as well as my ability to think critically and heuristically has improved dramatically as well. My collaboration and communication skills are much more refined as well, and I am much more comfortable with the dynamics and workflow of a professional, collaborative environment.</p>

                <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
                <p>This work term (and both of my work terms as whole) as a Data Collection & Integration Assistant at Kenna was a great experience. I came away from it with newfound/improved skills in Excel and SQL, as well as collaboration, time management, and communication. These skills and experiences will be greatly valuable to me as I move forward in my journey in computer science, both in school and in the workforce.</p>
